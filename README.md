##Architecture and Domain-Driven Design
This project was developed as part of an in-depth course on Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It demonstrates the practical application of these concepts by building a solution that reflects a solid, modular, and easily maintainable software design.

Project Content
The project is structured based on the principles of Clean Architecture and DDD, divided into modules that represent the learning stages.

Module 1: Clean Architecture
This module establishes the foundation of Software Architecture. It contrasts the complexity of "spaghetti code" with the clarity of a well-architected codebase.

Fundamentals: Definition and benefits of software architecture.

Four Components: Exploration of the Domain, Interface, Application, and Infrastructure layers.

Communication: Demonstration of the outside-in communication between layers and how abstraction protects the domain layer from infrastructure implementations.

Testability: Emphasis on the ease of testing the project, a core principle of Clean Architecture.

Module 2: Strategic DDD
Here, the focus is on aligning the code with the business. The project uses Strategic DDD concepts to map the company's domain into code.

Mapping Patterns: Application of patterns like Subdomains and Bounded Contexts to organize the code into namespaces.

Ubiquitous Language: Implementation of a shared glossary between business areas and the development team.

Context Integration: Discussion and application of patterns like Shared Kernel and Anti-Corruption Layer for communication between different contexts.

Context Map: Visualization of communication between contexts as a diagram that illustrates the domain boundaries.

Module 3: Tactical DDD
This module delves into the implementation of DDD, focusing on how to model the domain in practice.

Aggregates and Entities: Definition and implementation of Aggregates and Aggregate Roots to ensure the consistency of a set of objects.

Value Objects: Creation of immutable value objects (records in C#) to encapsulate business rules and represent real-world concepts.

Domain Services: Use of domain services for business rules that involve more than one aggregate.

Domain Events: Implementation of an asynchronous messaging system to signal important events, using the Outbox pattern to guarantee consistency in event publishing.

Tools: Use of Hangfire for asynchronous background processing of events, ensuring integration between contexts.

How the Modules Connect
The project demonstrates the relationship between Strategic and Tactical DDD. Strategic DDD defines the boundaries and language (Bounded Contexts and Ubiquitous Language) at a higher level of abstraction. Tactical DDD deepens the implementation within these boundaries, with concepts like Aggregates, Services, and Domain Events.

This combination allows for a solution that not only follows software architecture best practices but also remains flexible and aligned with business needs.
